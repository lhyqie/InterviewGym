	You are given a square grid of size dxd. It contains each of the numbers 1..n, where n = d^2.
	The numbers each occur once and only once, in arbitrary order. 
	Find the length of the longest sequence of adjacent consecutive numbers in the grid.
	For example,
	d=3
	1 2 9
	5 3 8
	4 6 7
	The longest is [6, 7, 8, 9], which has length 4.
